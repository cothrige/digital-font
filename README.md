# Digital Font
A bitmap font inspired by Artwiz Snap and OhSnap fonts, but available in more sizes in order to make it more versatile and usable. I have varied some of the glyphs for my own taste and therefore it is not exactly like its inspiration in every detail. This is most obvious in regards to the ampersand, "&", as I wished to avoid what I thought was a slight awkwardness in previous versions.
